/***************************************************
 *This is a USART library for the MSP430.
 *
 * It can provide basic USART (serial) communication for any application.
 *
 * This code is in the public domain. Feel free to do with it whatever you want.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * FOR STUDENTS:
 * 
 * This file will be given to you in an 'empty' state. The function bodies are
 * provided, but not their content. You are supposed to add the proper code
 * and complete these functions.
 * 
 * 
 * Hint 1: We do not expect you to write the most performant or exceptionally
 * well-engineered code, but it should work. If in doubt, sacrifice speed for
 * reliability.

void USART_Transmit_char(uint8_t data)
{
	// A nice hint: With interrupts, you can send bytes whenever the register UCA1TXBUF
	// is free. And there is an interrupt called UCTXIFG that *tells you*
	// whenever UCA1TXBUF is free.
	// This requires you to have some bytes in the buffer that you would like to
	// send, of course. You have a buffer, don't you?
}



// Transmits a given string
void USART_Transmit_String(char* string)

// Receives a single character.
char USART_Receive_char(void)
{
	// A nice hint: With interrupts, your microcontroller can inform you whenever
	// a character comes in. There is an interrupt called UCRXIFG for that.
	// If such an interrupt would fill a buffer with the received data, this
	// function here could return you one character from this buffer. You would no
	// longer need to 'wait for the byte to arrive', but could just fetch it out
	// of this buffer at any later point. And of course you've got a buffer,
	// right?
	// If the buffer is actually empty, you could maybe return a 0 or so to
	// indicate that to the user?
